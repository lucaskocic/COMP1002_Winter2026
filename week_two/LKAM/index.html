      <h1>All about Lucas</h1>
      <p>Im Lucas Kocic. Im someone who likes to keep things simple and honest. Im always trying to learn something new, whether its a skill, a hobby, or just figuring out how to handle life a bit better. Im not perfect, but I put in the effort, and I care about doing things the right way.
         I like being around people who are genuine and who dont pretend to be something they are not. I try to be that kind of person too someone you can rely on, someone who shows up, someone who listens. Most of the time, Im working on improving myself, spending time with the people I care about, or getting lost in whatever Im interested in at the moment.
         Im still growing, still figuring things out, and Im okay with that. I just want to keep moving forward and becoming a better version of myself.</p>
